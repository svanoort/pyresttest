# Changelog

## 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT (pending release as 1.6.0)
**Bugfixes:**
* Fix bug with cookies not being passed to extract_bind extrators, which caused: 
  - https://github.com/svanoort/pyresttest/issues/70
  - https://github.com/svanoort/pyresttest/issues/63
* Extractors did not raise an exception on failure: https://github.com/svanoort/pyresttest/issues/64

**Features:**
* raw_body extractor that returns the full HTTP response body
  -  Requested in: https://github.com/svanoort/pyresttest/pull/71
* run_tests.sh now exits on first failure, and returns exit code (for automation)
  - In PR: https://github.com/svanoort/pyresttest/pull/82
* Add test coverage script (uses 'coverage', which requires install)

**Known Issues / Back-Compatibility:**
* Headers are now lists of (key, value) pairs, extractors need to be aware of this
    - *Will only be an issue for people using custom header extractors*
    - This can be patched into a back-compatibile approach if it breaks anyone

**Misc:**
* Automation start (Jenkins setup, initial testing Dockerfile 
* and enhancements to script)
